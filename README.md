# Robot Game
  
  Developed in C++ using Qt. (https://www.qt.io/)

System Requirement: Qt version 5.11.1 (macOS). NOT TESTED on other platforms. 

Game Concept: Robots pits you against evil robots, who are trying to kill you (which is why they are evil). Fortunately for you, even though they are evil, they are not very bright and have a habit of bumping into each other, thus destroying themselves. In order to survive, you must get them to kill each other off, since you have no offensive weaponry. (Adapted from http://ctho.org/games/robots/ )
